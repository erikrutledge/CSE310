# Overview

This program is simply designed to print "Hello World!" to the screen when run.

This is the most common first program to write when learning a new language, in this case it is a Python (.py) file.

My purpose in writing this program is to demonstrate my understanding of writing a program, pushing it to GIThub, and hosting it in a public repository for others to view.
